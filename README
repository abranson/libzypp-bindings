Notes:

- Some classes are not wrapped but converted to
  equivalents:

Usage:

Requires swig and ruby installed.

Ruby Notes
==========

* API tries to follow ruby standards:
* zypp::Pathname -> std Pathname in ruby
* zypp::Date -> std Time in ruby
* ResStore does not implement iterators but:
  * each
  * each_by_name
  * etc
* lower case methods, ie: ZYppFactory::instance.get_zypp
  instead of ZYppFactory::instance()->getZYpp()
  z.initialize_target("/") for z.initializeTarget("/")
